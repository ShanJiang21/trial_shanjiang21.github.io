Death must be a perennial conundrum, troubles everyone from time to time and eversince I know that the *temporality nature* of my life, I have been always soaking in a sense of anxiety. I start to be worried about the dark days in a late night as I was lying down on my bed when I was about seven. It is like seperate some parts from your body, and the feeling of being hurted can really leave someone in a trap for a long while, hopeless and feeling meaningless.

When counting down how many days of life one may have for their own, the process of quantifying sometimes makes it clearer for us to reflect on the valuable treasure we have, that is, time.  

try to calculate how many words I can rememer in a certain period of time, and pushed myself to tolerate all the pain caused by the supression of eager, anger or sadness.

It has not changed too much since the middle school year. After I entered the college, the objectivity requirement in sociology, again, reinforced the alienation of myself, as an emotional human being and as a girl with unique personality.

Every culture has its own characteriscs, and some toxic elements. How lucky I am to have experienced two divergent culture in the youth, and these tiny reflections do help me understand how the culture kidnapped individuals and kills the Intellectual creativity.

I love Chinese poems, especially the ones appeared in Tang and Song Dynasty, when the poets have their romantized feelings expressed

Human beings are just a collection of bag of gases.

### The absence of Meso Level space

虽然如今在资本的驱动下，在中国涌现了大量的纯娱乐文化产品。

形式娱乐-内容娱乐本身就是两种不同的层次。

中国精神生活的极致空虚，在近些年的舆论环境下，显得愈发的急迫。

But what are the social forces that shape this consequence?

- The comedy types are repetitious and monotonous, the “content ” is more focused on using the physical, for the scripted dialogue to make people laugh, for example, in many popular sitcoms broadcasted in recent years, the background music will autoplay the *laugh* sound of a dozen of people, which is a typical way for affecting the emotions of the audience by using sound effects. But if you just take a step further, you may simply notice that, your smile may just come from the biological influence and probably you would never acknowledge this kind of thing as a intellectual enjoyment.

- Not being able to engage political life, makes the situation even worse;

### Basic Naming rules in Data Science

In Columbia, courses with certain key words are pretty popular these days. Especially these come with statistical learning and modelling tutorials which not only gives hands-on experience of programming language exploratory analysis, but also crucial mindset for data science in practice.

1. **Deep Learning**: In neural network models, when we have more than one hidden layer, then it is said that we are having a deep network, so we call the architecture ***Deep Learning***.
2. **Machine Learning**:
3. **Data Mining**:


### Experiment for social studies

Even though as a statistics student, I don't trust the surveys being conducted these days.

In medical and pharmaceutical area, clinical trial designs have their official guidelines and stringent rules for experiment design, data collection and causal inference, statistics students pay equal attention to both models and the assumptions of the models.

But in the social science field where I was in and plan to return, things are not playing like that.

Many projects are lack of rigorous design, there are few people thoroughly mulled over for the operationalization of the research. The transformation from a big-picture paradigm to the solid statistical analysis plan is never easy.

In clinical trials, the time taken for a new drug to be proved is usually ten years, after stepping down the Phase I, Phase II and Phase III trial, and by going through each section of the clinical trials, we can find that some features of the drug are being compared with the existing active controls or placebos.

Cause it matters for life, for most early phase trial patients, the newly-invented drug stands for the final glimmer signs of life and it is the tiny superiority that makes a difference.

To be honest, the hard scientist's scoff or prejudice on social science does make a little sense, if to evaluate by the methods adopted.

Why?

- What is the proportion of studies that are still in use of the survey methods in the social science research?

- How many of them are rigorously designed, evaluated?

- What are the result of bias or prices that we have to pay for these false conclusions or seemingly *significant* results?

I still remeber the shocking truth of interpretation of $$R^2$$ during one of my biostatistical methods class, in my college, one of my teacher said to us, the usual $$R^2$$ falls under 0.2 in the sociological research, while in that case study we got 0.67 or so for $$R^2$$ and my fellow classmates take it for granted, some of them even think that is too low to be a fairly acceptable model.

Hey, bro. If you have ever looked at the harsh life of statistician in social science,  you will know how lucky you are for now.

### The Frustration towards the subject itself

Learning statistics or jump into medical field does strike my hope and faith in the science, cause what we are trying to grasp can only be merely a part of the whole system. The hopeless experience comes naturally for medical students and social science students.
