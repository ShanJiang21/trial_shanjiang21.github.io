Stocks just climbbed up back, being the Dow’s biggest since March 2009.

Being the second hand information receiver for quite a long period on the virus topics, I have been tired of rumors, fake news and emotional articles. Even the most objective evidence, considered no bias in the academia, is found to be slanted now. So, is US really in a danger? Is the democrat the real fear monger? Should the public be panic, of course most of them are not, but who knows...

With all honesty, every little bit gonna be alright.

Sometimes I am just sort of Dorky, but just like the boy in the Circle said, the God gives me the confidence.
