Getting away from New York City, and travel for spring break means a lot to me.

>Starry night,
Comfortable temperature,
Nice drivers and servants,
The first day of arrival shall never be nicer.

Nice spring break just started from the blue clear sky and green field. With freezes blowing from further hills, loneliness and fear just faded away from my heart, no worries or suspicious ideas would be generated as I am living in this moment.

Fast and furious can be a salient feature for driving on the road across LA for sure. Even I was on board with my friend on a tour bus, I still feel the power to break restrictions and the freedom to embrace nature without any doubt.

Los Angeles shall be labeled as a glamorous city, reminding me of the shiniest memories in the past. The palm trees are scattered around accompanied by big houses.

Grown up in a Mountain area created more connections for me with this spacious place, there is no such a fever for skyscrapers as Los Angelas is built on an earthquake belt, which makes it more costly and challenging to construct high buildings than just a three story inn.

Danish town, a tiny niche, named Solvang, nestled in the Santa Ynez Valley that looks and smells like Christmas year-round.
