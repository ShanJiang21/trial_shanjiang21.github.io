## 危机时刻的知识分子

历史总是不断地重复自身，如今我面临的归国/工作/求学的选择，在全球公卫危机之下，显得格外困难，其所带来的后果，也给我带来沉重的压力。但知识分子，或者知识精英阶层对于人类命运的忧虑感 ，在中国社会，并不罕见。

中国人讲的「一代人」大概是30年，文化的传承需要弥合代际的差异，风雨如晦，鸡鸣不已。

现在讲的东亚研究，似乎已经不能cover这个丰富而又广泛联结的多样社会群体了。那么，语言还是成了一项最重要的身份认同的标志。也就出现了在Sinophone-汉语圈中的知识分子群体，不设清晰的民族国家边界，而是做出面向真理的选择和勇敢地承担后果（Leo Strauss *迫害与写作艺术*（隱微*寫作*(esoteric writing) ）。

### 世变之际的选择：陈寅恪，唐君毅

时光的镜头切回1957年，唐君毅到美国访问，为了纠正西方学界对于中国文化问题的偏见，他起草了一封信，并交与尚处台湾的张君劢，徐复观，牟宗三过目，此为后来所发表的《为中国文化敬告世界人士宣言》。

第二年，也就是1958年，在美国哈佛大学东亚系，一次偶然的机会，三年级的博士生余英时注意到历史学家陈寅恪《再生缘》；而《柳如是别传》

#### The New Game and New Era

William Overholt kicked off the lecture series in the China center at Harvard. He thought that we misread the history and provided a new perspective for us to see things differently. The deeply concern of China-US relations: military forces, our allies are not angles, while China is not demon. America has to paly the new game.

The typical way in which these conflicts are managed was first of all they were between neighbors and the neighbors Greg part of each other's territory Athens inspire Germany and France.

The Post World War Two conflicts are not like that.First we learned to grow economies much faster and more efficiently than the best and second military technology has become so destructive. **Of countries pursue the methods of the pre world war two era typically both will lose**.

**As a result, the path to becoming a great power has become primarily economic. This is a fundamental shift in the way the world works.**

**But it was our economic strategy that won the Cold War.** We delivered decisive aid and institution building programs to our allies and friends.**We created a global network of development.** The end of the Cold War was a bankruptcy an economic event.So that was our experience in the Cold War. What about other countries. Well, Japan, became a very big power without much of a military. South Korea was initially inferior economically, militarily and political stability to North Korea, but then general part Chinese shifted the emphasis.  **Today, the South Korean economy has 50 times the size of North Korea.**

From the time of ancient greece to World war II, the

**In China, Xiaoping Deng cut back the military from 16% of GDP and 3%.** And so most of Chinese border disputes in order to focus on economic development.

**A self fulfilling prophecy**

The things that our politicians denounce most like the plan for manufacturing 2025 should actually make them quite unhappy. China is repeating the mistakes that Japan made. Turning inward and trying over the economy to a group of inefficient traditional industries.Moreover, this Chinese administration is giving control over strategic business decisions and in every business.

Several decades of huge budget surpluses have given Chinese leaders, a bull market mentality.

**Third within a few years, China will will change dramatically.**

Its political strategy of maximizing control is at war with its economic strategy.**Of market efficiency.**

#### That generational changes now over

China has decades of rapid growth, have led to extremely sharp generational change. Each generational change brings in leadership with very different views and policies.**That generational changes now over**. Chine will experience fundamental change might get much better might get much worse, it will not remain the same.

Many us commentators led by Princeton's Aaron preborn argue that we can't live with another big power it has a different system.

**We have to live in the world as it is.** Not the world we wish.
