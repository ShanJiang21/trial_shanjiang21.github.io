Recently there is a viral suddenly spread on Github among Chinese computer engineers, on which they set up a project for protesting against the 996 work mode, which is a common practice in Internet

**996 vs. ICU**

What is 996?

A "996" work schedule refers to an unofficial work schedule (9 a.m. ~ 9 p.m., 6 days per week) that has been gaining in popularity. Serving a company that encourages the "996" work schedule usually means working for at least 60 hours per week.

What can I do?

* Update this list with evidence to help every worker.
* Add this badge to your project to support 996.ICU.
* License your awesome projects with the 996ICU License.
* Add proposals to give advise and suggestion about the development of 996.ICU.

Mapping the mechanism behind popular 996 work Demanding conditions

Struggle to have a life and work balance is due to the overtime working and strict conditions set on these young elites. They are deprived of their own life, thinking room, together with their happiness shared with family members.

Some digital media called 996 is a scandal for Chinese start-ups and giant technology empires, while I disagree with such criticism. The inside story is not fully presented by now.
