## No way out, no solutions against reality 

People are running circles, and this is a mad world. Feeling good with the

Over this past week, we have continued to maintain our ongoing constructive dialogue with the government, while pursuing litigation on a parallel track to protect the rights of TikTok and our community. Today, I am very happy to share that a court has granted an injunction preventing the implementation of the TikTok ban that would have prohibited new users to download the app that otherwise gone into effect tonight.

We will continue to seek to protect the rights of our users, partners, artists, employees, businesses, and creators in providing the joy, free expression, and means to livelihood that TikTok brings to so many in the US.

Put simply, right now this means is that there will be no change to our work and new users can continue downloading TikTok, existing users can continue using TikTok, and brands can continue running campaigns.

While our ongoing conversation with the government remains our priority and preference, we will continue to fight for the hundred million individuals who use TikTok for expression, connection, and entertainment, and for the creators who have turned their talent and creativity into thriving careers. TikTok will never waver in our commitment to them, or to you - the team that has built this incredible platform and community. Read our official statement here:

"We're pleased that the court agreed with our legal arguments and issued an injunction preventing the implementation of the TikTok app ban. We will continue defending our rights for the benefit of our community and employees. At the same time, we will also maintain our ongoing dialogue with the government to turn our proposal, which the President gave his preliminary approval to last weekend, into an agreement."

I will continue to update you with news as it becomes available. Enjoy the rest of your weekend, and thank you for being a part of this journey. #weareTikTok
