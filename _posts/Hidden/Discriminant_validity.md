`Discriminant validity`:  was tested by examining the correlation coefficients of each item within and among constructs. Each item should correlate highly with its intended construct, but not with other constructs. 

`Acceptable discriminant validity` is evidenced when the correlations within each construct exceed the correlations with all other constructs. 

In brief, differential item functioning (DIF) occurs when groups (such as defined by gender, ethnicity, age, or education) have different probabilities of endorsing a given item on a multi-item scale after controlling for overall scale scores.
