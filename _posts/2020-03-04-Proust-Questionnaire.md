It has been a while since I reviewed the course of [Dr.Sun from NTU](http://ocw.aca.ntu.edu.tw/ntu-ocw/ocw/cou/107S201). Recently, the course named Knowledge of sociology is updated, and this course is designed for graduate school students. In the lecture for introducing syllabus, he briefed on a list of to-do’s including one of the most interesting task: completing the Proust Questionnaire.

After doing some research on this scale, I found that some prestigious figures also completed this questionnaire before, including Karl Marx, whose answer is not quite shocking and commonplace, and Oscar Wilde who confessed his personal traits in his album.

> In 1865, [Karl Marx confessed](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1865/04/01.htm) that he considered his chief characteristic “singleness of purpose,” and that his favorite occupation was “bookworming.”

> Oscar Wilde wrote in an album called “Mental Photographs, an Album for Confessions of Tastes, Habits, and Convictions” that his distinguishing feature was “inordinate self-esteem.”

So, I also tried to fill in this form to recall some of my hobbies, preferences, hopefully it will be a good reflection of my personal traits.
