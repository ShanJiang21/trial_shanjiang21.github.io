### Cancel culture

> If you haven’t heard the word "canceled" in this past year concerning someone, then you’ve been blissfully minding your own business. It’s become a trend for when someone does something that the population generally agrees is wrong, to ‘cancel’ them. The term, in its context on social media, finds its origin in the populous ‘black twitter’. It’s usually used when an individual does something that is racist, homophobic, misogynist, etc.  That sounds fair and decent. Being canceled is a product of this day and age of social media, notably twitter.
