*Dance Monkey* is a really nice song that attracts me, especially when I get to know that it is for grandpa. Always have someone to challenge myself is always a good start, I would not feel bored with it. However, trust someone takes time and effort. We are all afraid of being cheated. I view fidelity the most important thing in the relationship.

Lifehacks are hard to grasp, just like picking up a suitable city to live in.

> Chase success if you have a particular reason to, but never think that it can solely constitute a good life. When you define yourself by an externally controlled and incredibly powerful bureaucracy, you do a disservice to the best parts of you.

Accidentally, I saw some posts regarding *Meritocratic Society* and the inheritance system on Reddit and my personal social media page which was shared by a college classmate.

To be honest, I would always judge my friends for not getting into the best grad school/job in their area etc., I sometimes find it nasty, and I cannot even deal with it, while the holly reality is that most people don't  have it and that's okay. I found I am a tamed sheep and for everyone I meet I usually judge by the same standard, just like people around me did.

I was someone judging others on such a thing, especially my loved parents, they keep inform me that it is a disrespect and people cannot be simply be judged by the elite backgrounds thing. However, my elderly cousin holds the opinion for a long time (even until now), and he did play a critical role in shaping my view of the evaluation system: use brands and elite schools to distinguish friends, and only connect with these well-educated ones. Disagreement happens when he is trying to navigate a body shame for me, he endlessly forced me  to conform to beauty standards, asking me to do some make up as he never awares that it is enough to cause deep shame and self-loathing for girls.

I feel lucky that I gave a second thought to his opinion on judging girls by their appearances, it is an intrinsically mental disease. It is deadly for personal growth, and it is a harmful perspective and it is time to change instantly for my own perspective.

Be Tolerant to different voices is challenging, but as a mellanials-generation adult I need to.

Usually, I don't care what the material wealth that some one possessed or owned, but when I did a reflection on the so-called characteristic, one more thing that is more significant stands out. To educate an elite, average families need to commit most of the resources they own so that the cultural heritage can be inheritated naturally. This is even more expensive than the wealth itself, since it includes sound cultivation of personal interests, great visions, unique tastes, and they are preferred by the meritocratic sorting machine. Thus, the implied meaning of ignorance on physical wealth is not a cherish for the simplicity, it does mean a higher standard for the individual.

我可爱的试用期，病假比年假多，听说是因为加班多，打工人，需加油。 // What a lovely trial period, sick leave is haliriously more than annual leave. I have heard from a friend the fact is owing to the 996 working schedule that giant tech companies' employees get used to in China, because if overwork is gonna deprive the health of each individual, and we are drowning in such a joy luck club.

这让我想起了小声喧哗最近的一期节目，讲述那些在金融危机后被收走房产，只能重回就业市场，没有社会安全网兜底的老龄劳工的境遇——他们住进了自己的白色房车，勤恳地工作，并对世界宣告：我不是无家可归，我只是没有房产。// The fun fact reminds me of the latest session of *Loud Murmurs*, anchors dicussed about the dilemma and the miserable fate of the elderly baby boomer generation, they have to go back to the labor market to find a job to feed themselves, this is called *CamperForce* Issue, but they were the most decent middle class workers and they do possess great work ethic compares with millennials. Most important, they have a firm belief that they always have a roof on their head.

Involution was once in a while a heated topic in my tiny New York apartment, however, now it became popular again, used for describing the state of over-competition for these elite walks of life.

Beautifully expose some of the underlying concerns and problems in the relationships accidentally happens to me. As a quasi-christian,  [SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE IS A SIN](https://corechristianity.com/resource-library/articles/9-bible-verses-that-teach-that-sex-before-marriage-is-a-sin/) is no stranger to me, I read it from Exodus and Hebrew, from these lines I got to know it is a commitment and matters. But for the Christian, marriage has never been the goal. Biblical marriage and sexuality are meant to point us to the God who ordained it all in the first place (Ephesians 5:31-31; Revelation 19:6-8).

This op-ed from [*New York times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/opinion/sunday/sex-christian.html) discussed this question and proposed some possible ways of having sex for christians.
