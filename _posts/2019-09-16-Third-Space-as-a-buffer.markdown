From a young 6-year-old little girl to a 23-year-old adult woman, what and where has helped/benefitted me most? 

I try to ask myself, the inclusive sets certainly my *family*, *school*, and the temporal phase in *professional occasions*. If measured by the length of my life, so far the longest and the only thing I have insisted on doing is *staying at school*, no matter doing courseworks or serving as a research assistant, the inner voice keeps talling me the campus is a **safe bubble** for me, despite the compensation of getting a low-pay and intense burden sometimes, also the endless deadlines that never disappear even in my dream.  

I still rememeber the noisy farmer's market where I grew when I was young. As a veteran, my dad did what he can to best utilize the stipend he received when he retired from the army. He started a grocery store with my mom, operating from 4:00 am to 6:00 pm every day, except for the Spring Festival. Namely, they work almost 360 days each year for about 18 years until last year after I graduated from college. 

He failed to get in the local SOE when he was about 35 years old, while that implies the door for uplifting for him. 


Have you ever given a thought to the rotisserie chicken sold in Walmart/Costco? 

Some of the unnoticable details from the vendor along the street are always the source of happiness. 

### Trickle-down Economics

In economics history of U.S, there is once upon a time when Reaganomics were popular in the 1980s.

Before Reagon came to power, there is high unemployment and persistently high inflation. In other word, it was called stagnation.

It advocates cuts to the tax, which goes to the weathy and celebrities who are at the top of the pyrimaid. 

### Loneliness in Collectivism

>  Scourage of the South Korea.

These who are close to him are even more surprised than the fans. 

I hate the labelling, it attaches atigma, ignores the heterogenity of the individual and often is the source of bias and hatred, no matter how strong you try to deny the fact.

Can you imagine, it’s neither Canada nor Sweden, these previously “freezing hell” which has the highest suicide rate, it is South Korea, the sense of shame deeply rooted in the asian culture has shaped the mindset of young people in the most beautiful country. 

The suicide appeared on media and the influence of celebrity suicide were investigated a lot, while in China, a systematic channel or access to psychological heal is hard to find.


**Third Space sociology**

> The term **Third Space** or **Third Place** was coined by the sociologist Ray Oldenburg in the early 90s in his book *The Great Good Place*.

*Farmers' Market*

Every Tuesday there are tons of vegetables, bread and groceries freshly on sale in front of the Hammer library which is just a symbol of third space in the U.S., it diminished the distance from the food source to the consumers, increases the trust between individuals and also lifts the commerical value of the food produced. Historically, the market has been a great place for information transmission and construct of unique social networks, which has been reserved until now. While some places have similar functions just like the market, take a look at the Starbucks around the corner, you may have a better idea why it has made so big a profit. 

Third space in urban life is common while more rely on the intentional maintainance and the conquer of capital is the biggest threat to the phenomenon.

Just as the headlines indicated: *Cafes, Coffee Shops, Bookstores, Bars, Hair Salons, and Other Hangouts* at the Heart of a Community. Though home and workplace have been two places which take the dominant role in our daily life, these small stops on the road home are great buffer from the work and housekeeping duties.

 It is not uncommon that East Asian societies, people pay a lot more attention to the pursuit of external judgment to avoid being pubnished while always they don’t even know how to care for themselves, even if that is considered as his/her right since the date of birth. Besides, society also labels personal care as high-end enjoyment or abuse of money, the betrayal of si mple and plain lifestyle.
