You made my day.

> 认识世界，克服困难。洞悉所有，贴近生活。寻找真爱，感受彼此。这就是生活的意义。
> You've said it and I couldn't agree more: "Freedom ain't free."

同事分享了她在冰岛雷克雅未克租车环岛的奇幻旅程，也勾起了我要去冰岛的愿望，不得不说，这部片子更像是一部风光片，去玩滑板，去骑行，去hiking，我觉得看完这部电影，其实真正传达的是一种在生活中认清真相之后依旧热爱，依旧stride for pride的勇气。

中国公司出海/国际化，难免会面临本土化的问题。

这也就证明了为什么在我们的产品部门为什么还会存在policy部门这样一种反人类的存在。

这就像以前在学校中常常听到的「中国社会学本土化」这样的问题一样，总有不同学派的scholar为此笔墨官司争执不停。但是在中国本土化过程中，新劳工群体，劳工意识与文化似乎都没有很系统性的研究（也正常，毕竟之前出海的中国企业/品牌也很少)。

*阴阳打工人*:
指的是一些就职于中国的出海公司，致力于国际化业务，因为项目复杂多变，对接全球各大时区的POC，且必须第一时间做出应急处理的打工人，因其开会时间多在深夜/清晨，或由深夜开到清晨，故称之为阴阳打工人。

Few teams have a 12 hour on-call cycle where one person is online for 12 hours while the other person who is located in a different timezone sleeps peacefully.


### How urgent is your work?

Recently, I watched a new TV series called `9-1-1`, which sort of echos my current job content. Instead of just enjoying the trailer, I chose to binge watch several episodes while enjoying a young coconut treat (sweet yet refreshing).


On-call scheduling, sometimes referred to as on-call shifts are processes used in business where employee work schedules are intentionally unpredictable



You need to take care of all the operational issues/bugs/tickets while you are on-call.

Late night/early morning calls suck as the system are trapping me and treating me like a phone which.  

Escaping from the disclosure from the public does not mean that the real-life emergecies are solved or can be healed at the moment, thus we do need an extra layer of

二更视频最近模仿日本《我可以和你一起回家吗？》搞了一个“最后一班地铁”栏目，在杭州拍摄，其中一个在大厂做UR的海归小姐姐密密的生活状态很有共鸣：

> 从密密身上仿佛看到了另一个自己。基本一样的留学背景，回国后步入社会的一些不适，在工作中不断面临的挑战和焦虑，下班后一个人的独处，习惯了凡事自己扛，不敢生病怕耽误工作身边也无人照料，但偶尔也渴望爱情降临.....  脱离父母的呵护和保护后，才发现成年人的生活从来都不易。 密密满脸善意的笑容好温暖，那就愿你和我，还有其他在追逐梦想的年轻人，不论经历什么，都拥有迎难而上的勇气，也可以尽力保有对生活的点滴热爱吧～

On a personal level, I feel great if I am being acknowledged. However, it is usually awkward for me to respond to such apprecitaion or compliments upon the moment.

Never settle for a single place until you find the place you are passionate about.



* **偏见**：看Minari这样深刻，但会令我痛苦两周的文艺片 要比看甜甜的，但给我带来满足和开心的韩剧高尚；
* 目前我所经历的阵痛，很可能和自己非常有限的生活阅历和情绪反应正相关：
  * 一种近乎于洁癖式的清高: 理想
  * 内心预判的鄙视链: 看纪录片真的就比看沙雕综艺高尚吗？
  * 对于guilty pleasure的抵抗：但是世界上是有纯粹的快乐的，明明已经被工作每天按在地上摩擦，为什么不放过自己，喝一杯让自己开心的奶茶？

性格的中性不应该成为职场上的blocker，仅有的女性性格优势应该助力我们，成为我们职业发展中的助推器。

Don't be too harsh on yourself.

Guilty Pleasure: 垃圾小说/破电视剧/anything可以帮助自己撑下来，都没有关系。

When you love someone, I am gonna give myself the love tonight, we will see every night we spent together. Lift to touch the sky together, you and I will.....

It's okay not to be okay sometimes and generally we are not that cool like what others are viewing us. It is not only due to that we pretend to play the role that the society presumes us to be, for which we encounters severe role conflicts, but also we found ourselves are lacking the required adaptability.

I need to be frankly that I do have come a long since where I began. Initially, I was planning to spend only a pretty tiny period here in ByteDance, and returning back to the States to continue my past academic dream in computational social science.

This is also a reminder to me when I always feel bad about myself. The things I imagine when I was sitting in my office or my tiny room are not how I find them when I actually go out into the real world.



Recently I have always been catching a friend off guard as a consequence of my Emotionally *unstable* personality disorder. I just felt unsatisfied with what I have been working on.

Usually, I've found myself being equivocal on making decisions.

social and class inequality has always been a heated topic in public discussion.

The migration saga of *Nomadland* does prove its symbolic meaning and value for documenting and navigating us how these elderly people are living in RVs to wander on the road trip to find themselves.

Acclimatization always happens at the early days when you first arrive at somewhere new. Migration of youngsters in the new era is no longer a legend any more, individuals who own enough talent the bravery to choose

I cannot imagine how my personal/social roles can be evolved, but it definitely requires endless efforts and practice.
