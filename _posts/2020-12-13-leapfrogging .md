> **Act your age, not your shoe size.**

You better believe me, if not somebody special, then it shall passed. Even the delicious Sweet & Green that I craved for cannot even be recalled by me, nothing except for my beloved friends or family members can stay quite a long time.

Non-victim mentality is something I was lacking of. I also realized this from the discussions I had along my walking. Life has given me the freedom to choose, I do have the right to stay in my comfort zones in terms of some special fields, such as virgin or the purity of my mind. There must be a place in my heart that I keep for myself, even conflicting with the social norms or the cultural heritage, I still persist, no matter how hard it may become, I know the price that the fate gives for each gift, I will only take the thing I really need, while leaving the materialism behind.

Truth never betrays me. Spending a cozy Sunday afternoon in my bed, watching the *Ice Storm* healed me, although it is a story discussing about the family, love, and sex.  The frosty examination of 1970s America gives me a hint on why I may have piles of doubts and concerns inside my heart. As a highly-sensitive individual, this seems to be a drawback or at least something not that positive. While the thing is that  it does serve as an external protection layer, just like the warm fur you saw on fox.  The tragedy in the ending reminds me of my principles, I do have the rationality and control over myself. Being bounded by ethical rules is never a shame, sexual liberation does not mean that every human being shall pursue the most `basic sexual needs` that they are craving for. It is a choice, we have the right to choose to have it before or after marriage, but we still have the choice and shall be respected to not have it.

If you take the responsibility and you chose to go off the rails, then that would definitely cause hurt to your beloved ones, I am not saying that cannot be forgiven, but hurt is hurt. The broken glass simply would not get back to the consolidated one.

Act like an adult means a lot, and I would also teach myself to figure out what are my cravings and what price I would like to pay.

BTW, I almost fall in love with the smile of Tobey Maguire. How simpatico it echos with the ending.


#### `偶然力:serendipity`

Sagacity learned / picked up from accidents, accidental sagacity.

> **此詞源自於十四世紀的波斯神話「錫蘭三王子」（The Three Princes of Serendip）**，在這類似《一千零一夜》的長篇故事中，描述**錫蘭國王計畫磨鍊三位王子，於是讓他們徒步旅行各地，培養對應偶發事務的處理能力**；而這三位王子總是能**靠著意外和智慧發現一些蛛絲馬跡，進而解決問題**。當三位王子歷經磨鍊、返回家鄉後，他們發明了「serendipity」這個字，以紀念旅程中一切**在無預警的情況下所遇到的好運，以及學習到的智慧**。

I do appreciate the serendipity, but I never think I am worth that. Everything I obtained or acquired, was and will be through the hard work of mine. The tough year has taught me to forgive someone or forget about the miserable things that keep me from adulting.

After finishing 10 km running in the noon, I felt accomplished and I posted on my social media. I do want positive reinforcements and encouragements, but that can be either natural or processed. To choose the former one, it takes time and efforts. You might feel painful, but that is touchable and that makes the life counts. However, the social media thumbs-up is nearly at no cost. The male gaze or audience gaze would push me doing it for a while, but that joy is temporary and transient. Realizing that is a fake is a progress for me.  

Also, next week let me try to make more vegetables and fruits engage my life, acting as an energetic **flexitarian**. I do love this fucking real world.

还是很爱这句词：谁能够将天上月亮电源关掉,它把你我沉默照得太明了.
Move on.
