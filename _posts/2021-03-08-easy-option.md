#### Some personal feelings as a junior tech employee

TBH, ByteDance is actually an easy option for me, as it enjoys a good reputation on the labor market. The daily life is well-managed: each meal is ordered from vendors, prearranged and distributed in the office, every festival you will see celebration decorations and get the small free gifts. ByteDance also provides living bonus to move close to the office and I can still work with many US colleagues who graduated from top universities. All in all, as a new grad this can be an easy way to go.

While all seems to be fantastic. I should have no excuse to complain, there is still an underlying paradox.

The whole system works like an endless loop, a post-modern social engineering program, the unhappiness originates from it is not that easy to realize at the first time. I am quite prepared to it, but I do observed some other thing when seeing through some tiny stuff.

The eureka moment came when I saw an outside layer of the tea bag being easily thrown on the funnel bottle. I was quite pissed off when I noticed the small plastic being placed in a wrong place, however, when I go one step further, I start to realize it is not the fault of that specific individual/employee who just threw it there.

It is something being nurtured in the "attention factory", and this is just an externalization issue that people always forget to perceive, which is the collective unconsciousness. To put it simply, an engineer's core responsibility is finishing his/her OKRs in a given period of time. Other than that, the company assumes he who is a working machine shall spend no time on cleaning his own mess--even if it's a mess--as that can be a serious waste of time.

> Don’t accept being coddled (treat in an indulgent or overprotective way).

When we are being fed with the food, I am afraid that one day I will lose the capability to hunt for food. That is when the alienation enacts repetitively, and that is also when I am forced to run away from myself after working for lengthy hours.

隔了这么多年, 重新看《致遥远的你》非常感触。说实话，过劳的外科医生比互联网中996生活的大厂员工们压力还要大，这群负重前行的人们背负了太多的期待，承担着太过沉重的责任，无法想象在这种重压下保持生命热情的人，是有多么坚强。所以, 向他们看齐, 牢记 low memorial library的一句话 `enter to learn,leave to serve.`

非常喜欢今天TNS双月刊中的yushuang分享的一句话，在中国feminist都被媒体贴上了一种怪异的标签：Unhappy women who blame their unfortunate lives on men. 这种性别形象的简单二元化真的是万恶之源，有时甚至是有一种蓄意制造的性别对立，真的灰常evil

今天看到BBC的一篇文章：**WHAT ARE THE NEURAL BASES OF WANTING AND LIKING?** 其中说到 “想要”比“喜欢”更加贴近人性的根本，来自U Michigan Berriage的[研究](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/berridge-lab/)。归根结底，要延续我们的基因，喜欢不喜欢食物并不重要。更为重要的是，想不想去找食物，真的是非常refresh的概念。可能这样就解释了，我长这么大也不知道什么是喜欢吧 ～ 母单的怨念，Lonely God is me.

今天因为说了一句“腾笼换鸟”，就一天被问到两次我是哪里人。果然大家都会眼里都会有一些认知判断的shortcut.

It is such a gloomy rainy day. This morning, I have had a great talk with a remote friend in the States. He also shared some great metaphors about the dilemmas that youngsters are now experiencing.

> 我也有自己的死胡同，困在里边出不来，但这样至少不会迷路哇，这是最近听到的很温暖的话了，棒。

愈加体会到自己是个讲话纠结且怪怪的小朋友，难怪大家都说我是客客气气，不敢麻烦别人，怯生生的书呆子，还外加拖延症晚期患者，卒。

I really love the so-called `pragmatic romanticists`  title given for ByteDancers. Today marks the 9th anniversary of this giant unicorn start-up, funny stickers and call-out culture echos my passion.

算法真的很神奇：Hmmmmmm这首在TikToK曲库被疯狂使用，但我却没找到的歌，网抑云给我精准扶贫了，有些滑稽，还是我司的消重模型不太行啊～于是就这样顺藤摸瓜找到了原曲：叫做 Late Night Melancholy，来自rude boy。

这首歌和下雨天的咖啡更配哦～
