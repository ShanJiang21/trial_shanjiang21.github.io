A spectre is haunting Europe – the spectre of coronavirus. The glimmer of hope is destructed because of the comments and the power dynamics in the academia, I always throw myself in some dilemma and it cannot be worked out without the help of myself.

### You know what?

Life is not always happy as it should be. I failed all my phd applications, and fail to meet the expectations, how to respond to that in trying period? I can only study more to overcome the loneliness of quarantine. The changing world order described by Bridgewater CEO is hard to be gripped with. The only one thing I can invest in is myself, given the current situation. Layoffs hitting more white collar jobs — and even health care workers, I found it hard for me to enter the job market without knowing the economics principles and got a better sense of the whole world.

To enter the financial market takes time and effort, and I will try to do that by using a smarter way of learning after taking this course. You know what? I still need a higher degree and insights into the novelty and the future plan is not a fake.

My Future plan: choosing HK’s Phd Program in communication, foreseeable future I would still need to make my own decisions on whether to go directly to the PhD program or just find a job on the market. When being lockdown, without family members, the attention on myself or a sense of security always come from a gain of achievement of learning something new. Otherwise I would have no idea whether it is a new day or just an expansion of yesterday. This psychological feeling is significant for personal growth and maturity. picky boss does not exist, but the knowledge for the future can be equipped for.
